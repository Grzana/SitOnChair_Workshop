 ## Description
 
The webpage was created based on knowledge of only HTML and CSS. There is no RWD implementation. 
The aim of the workhop was to improve skills connected to:
[HTML]
* webpage layout - using wrapper, heading, footer;
* headers (h1 - h3 etc.);
* inserting menu, lists, forms;
[CSS]
* managing classes, id's and other attributes;

[JavaScript]
In the next step of the workshop a section for calculating price was added. It is based on JavaScript code. It performs simple cost calculations depending which chair option was chosen by the user.
